# SecretSanta
This year new years party was at ours. Usually we play secret Santa between families and create a skit with a common theme but different genres.

I built this program to automize the process and to make secret Santa trully secret this year.

The program takes a txt file with families in it and a txt file with genres. And returns txt files with a name of the reciepient family in its title. Inside the file there is a frendly massage that notifies a recipient of a family that they are going to give the present and the genre they got for the new years skit. 

The program also makes sure that no families recieve themselves as a secret Santa and no family gets two secret Santas
